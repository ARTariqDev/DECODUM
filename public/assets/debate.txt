opf team h #1
defense:
strts by bill
describes selfishness by examples
human nature prioritizes itself
humans CANT ever by altruistic
example: natural selection
better for humanity as a whole
counterpoint : competing can be an example of seeing each other as equals
describes society rather than human nature 

opposition #1
sympathy better, shown with example
quotes a study thats relevant  to dismatnle claim that selfishness is biologically inherent
goes itnto more studies rather than refrencing the defense more
good argument but does not refrence the defenses points enough, a bit generic

def#2
personal gain at core of human behaviour
addresses oops points in a strucered goood manner, content could be slightly better, strategy is nice
addresses opps points (counters a study, money example)

opp#2
startegy is fine could be better, some arguments could be dismantled , not timed good

def#3
good start, addrese arguments directly and dismantles them, conntent a bit redundant

opp#3
runs through too many arguments at once, some not expanded upon
POI#1 6.8/10
POI#2 4/10
